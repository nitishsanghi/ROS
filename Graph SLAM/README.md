# Graph SLAM using RTAB-MAP

In this project a 2D occupancy grid and 3D octomap  were created from a simulated environment using a custom robot with the RTAB-Map package. RTAB-Map (Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping) is a popular solution for SLAM to develop robots that can map environments in 3D. rtabmap_ros package was used to interact with RTAB-MAP API. A custom package was developed to interface with the rtabmap_ros package. An RGB-D camera was added to the robot model for mapping. The gif illustration below captures the snippet of the mapping as the robot moves around.

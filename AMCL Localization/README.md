# Localization Using ROS Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization Package

In this project, ROS Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) package in C++ libraries is utilized to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the Gazebo simulation environments. A ROS package is created that launches a custom robot model in a custom Gazebo world. Utilizing the ROS AMCL package and the Tele-Operation / Navigation Stack the custom robot is localized.

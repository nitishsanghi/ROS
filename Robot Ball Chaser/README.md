# Mobile robot Ball Chaser
The goal of this project is to use Gazebo and ROS libraries to design, build, and house a mobile robot in an simulated environment and make the robot chase after white balls. Gazebo is used to design the simulated building environment with objects. The robot was designed using URDF (unified robot description format) which allows defining robot configuration and adding sensors in a simple easy way. The robot is programmed with C++ nodes in ROS to chase a white ball till it is out of view. Custom ROS packages were built, one for the robot and the simulation environment, and the second for driving the robot and image processing. The second package has the ROS nodes which program the robot to chase a white ball. The nodes use ROS publisher/subscriber services to communicate information which enables to robot to accomplish the desired task. Below is a gif showing the robot in action.
